###### Development notes

- Create patches for the github workflows that check and bump the version of the `\setup-dotnet@v4` action
- Port `sed` patches to python patcher for better failure observability
- Consider any other patches/automations to keep patches compatible with upstream into the future
- Consider relaxing linting exceptions in build process
