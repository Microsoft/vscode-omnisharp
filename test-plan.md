# Validating C# Extension for VS Code

#### Opening projects
When you open a directory in VS Code, the C# extension should look for a .csproj or .sln file in that directory and use "OmniSharp" to load it. 
If you look in "Output > Omnisharp Log" a bunch of information should be printed about what copy of MSBuild was used and what projects were load

Project types to test:
* Standalone csproj 
* Directory containing .sln file that references csprojs--projects should be loaded 
* .NET Core/.NET Standard csproj
* (Windows) Desktop .NET projects
* Unity projects

The easist way to verify that a project was successfully loaded is to open a .cs file within it and verify that the references codelens indicator appears.

#### Specific projects to test opening (on all OSes):
* `dotnet new console` in a directory
* A more complex dotnet solution, eg. [1] 
* A console app solution created in Visual Studio

#### Unity
* Follow the directions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity to configure VS Code with unity
* Try editing a project like https://github.com/staceyhaffner/SuperSpaceShooter

#### Intellisense 
* The completion list in a file contains symbols defined in references and in the file
* If you write a documentation comment on a symbol, the completion list displays it

#### Signature Help 
* Signature Help shows up in a method call after typing `(`
* Signature help shows documentation for methods and for parameters
* Parameter documentation is only shown for the currently active parameter

#### Quick Info
* Hovering over an identifier shows info and documentation

#### Formatting
* The "Format Document" command works
* Pressing enter inside a method body automatically indents the new line

#### Go To Definition
* F12 from callsites to definition
* Ctrl-Click
* Can go to metadata for symbols defined in metadata

#### Go To Implementation
* Ctrl-F12 on virtual member shows implementations

#### Find All References
* Shift-F12 on a symbol shows a reference list

### Reference highlighting
* Clicking on a symbol name should highlight other references to it in the same file

#### Colorization
* Appropriate colorization of keywords, literals, identifiers

#### Error squiggles
* Introducing an error should show a squiggle in the editor and an error message in the "problems" window
* Messages in the "problems" window should appear only once per unique error (see https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1830)

#### Quick Fixes
* Add using should be availble (does not currently suppport adding references)
* Generate variable/generate method should show up for missing members
* Remove unncessary usings should show up
* (this is not an exhaustive list)

#### Refactorings
* `Use expression body for methods` should be available
* `Rename file to match type` should correctly rename the file. The renamed file should be open after the refactoring
* (this is not an exhaustive list)

#### Code Lens - References
* References codelens appears on symbols and shows correct Find All References results

#### Code Lens - Unit Tests
* In unit tests projects, the "run test" and "debug test" codelens appears on test methods
  * Clicking runs or debugs the test and prints results to the console
  * Breakpoints in a unit test are hit if you "debug test"
* "Run All Tests" and "Debug All Tests" code lens buttons will appear on test classes
  * Click Run All or Debug All should run/debug all the tests in the class and print a summary
  * If you set breakpoints within multiple tests, you should hit each breakpoint as the tests are run

#### Symbol Finder
* Ctrl-T can find symbols by name when you type them
  * Symbols have appropriate glyphs

#### Rename
* Rename can rename symbols

#### File Watching
* In a project that uses globbing (.NET Core), use the VS Code file explorer to add a new file next to the csproj. Intellisense/sighelp/etc should be available in the new file
* Add a new file and reference a type in it from a different file. Deleting from disk the file containing the referenced type  should produce error messages

[1] For example,
```
mkdir project
mkdir test
dotnet new console -o project
dotnet new xunit -o test
dotnet add test\test.csproj reference project\project.csproj
dotnet new solution -n solution
dotnet sln solution.sln add test\test.csproj project\project.csproj
```
