Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

-   Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
-   Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
-   Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
-   Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).
